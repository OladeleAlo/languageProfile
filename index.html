          <p class="firstp">I received a job offer mid-course, 
            and the subjects I learned were current, 
            if not more so,in the company I joined. 
            I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
            working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

      “ Before joining the bootcamp, 
      I’ve never written a line of code. 
      I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
      I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
      The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
      The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
      It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
      I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
       It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”

      “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
      The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer.
       The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
